## New Feature: Background Resource Installation
This has been a feature that was requested multiple times, the first occurence of this being in October of last year. After almost a year of hard work, we are pleased to finally be able to ship this feature to Collapse. You are now able to install games across multiple regions at the same time! Keep in mind that there may be some quirks with the feature so we encourage you to come tell us if you have any issues either on our Discord or via GitHub Issues!

You can track the progress of installations via the new Notification panel introduced in our last major version release.

## New Addition: Interface Update
Shipping with Collapse 1.71.8 is a somewhat updated menu navigation system. The launcher logo has now been converted to a button, which will bring you to the home page of your currently selected game. The icons for Game Repair, Cache Repair (where applicable), Game Settings & App Settings are not permanently displayed as a vertical Navigation bar, with the ability to toggle the full-width menu by clicking on the hamburger icon. Furthermore, we've added the ability to go back to your previous page. Finally, there have been design tweaks here and there (notably in the "App Settings") to make the UI look and run better!

We introduced this change as part of the feedback we've gotten from you guys. Please keep sharing your thoughts regarding this and future features, as it helps us improve the experience for all Collapse users!

## New Addition: Genshin Impact Settings (Thanks @Myp3a, @neon-nyan, @CryoTechnic, @bagusnl, @muscularcandy67 !)
Genshin Impact finally gets Game Settings! Change graphics settings while outside the game and get it applied immediately as soon as you open the game!
Also with this, we added option to run **ALL GAMES** in borderless windowed mode!

## Major Changes
### Rewrite ``GameUninstall`` function
Rewriting this part of Collapse allows us to more easily manage how games get uninstalled and prevent the deletion of certain directories (e.g. Screenshots). The code used before was inefficient and would often need patching every other version, so we rewrote it for ease of maintainability and reliability. While at it, we also made it faster!

## New Version Number Indicator
Previously, the version number was only listed in the Console, which you needed to enable and made troubleshooting and helping resolve issues much harder for us. From this version onwards, the "PRE" tag has been replaced by the full version descriptor, alongside the "PRE" indicator if the build is a Preview build. Furthermore, for those who like to compile Collapse, we've appended the character "d" to the version number, as well as "PRE" to indicate that this build is a Debug build, while also being in preview testing. 

To summarize:
- Stable: [Version Number] (e.g. 1.71.8)
- Preview: [Version Number]-PRE (e.g. 1.71.8-PRE)
- Debug: [Version Number]d-PRE (e.g. 1.71.8d-PRE)

This allows us to easier help troubleshoot issues with our launcher depending on the version that the user is using.
