  - This reduces CPU overhead by removing routines to copy the video frames from software-based ``SoftwareBitmap``, and instead use Direct3D-based ``CanvasBitmap`` as the frame source.

- **[Imp]** CodeQA based on Qodana and ReSharper suggestions, by @neon-nyan

# 1.82.8 - Welcome to Natlan!
After many long months of waiting, we're proud to present our stable users with a new version of Collapse.

This release brings so many from preview, that at this point, this changelog might be the longest one we've ever written.
Some changes include a new built-in, app-wide proxy, full support for Zenless Zone Zero, parallelized file downloads (new downloader), new custom background selector (per region and video support), toast notification support, new downloader logic, new playtime tracking UI and logic, bandwidth limiter, playtime synchronization, game file cleanup, automatic error collection.
Among those, are also a bunch of dependency updates that are bundled with Collapse that will ship with this update, notably 7z, among other things.

Thank you for being patient with us while we work on bringing you the best version of Collapse possible. For details, read on!

Because of the particularity of this update, instead of listing it off in topics and subtopics, we're simply going to list off all the changes since the last version sync.

> Due to changes in our data collection mechanism, our Privacy Policy has changed!
> Please [read them here](https://github.com/CollapseLauncher/Collapse/blob/main/PRIVACY.md)
> For those who does not want error reporting enabled, please set system environment variable "DISABLE_SENTRY" to "true" before updating to this version.

> Collapse now has its own website, hosted on a brand new domain! Visit [https://collapselauncher.com/](https://collapselauncher.com/) for an in-depth documentation of Collapse's features!

### **[New]** Adding Acrylic Effect support for Video Background, by @neon-nyan
Previously, the acrylic effect while using Video Background is disabled due to a bug under WindowsAppSDK's Direct3D component which causes the entire UI to have solid dark color. After few releases later, we finally figured out a method to possibly blend the UI's Acrylic effect with the Video Background frame under it by passing video frames as a ``CanvasDevice`` and project it into ``Image.Source``. This feature, however is single-threaded and might get choppy when switching between pages.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c14e7181-5aa6-46a1-8fab-f803c9321b37)

This feature, however is disabled by default. In order to enable this, go to the ``App Settings`` and check the ``Use Acrylic Effect while using Video Background`` toggle under ``Video Background Settings`` setting.

### **[New]** Notification Toast Support for Background Activities, by @bagusnl & @neon-nyan
This feature will help users to get notified when a background activity is completed. The notification toast includes support for Game Installation, Game Update, Pre-load Download, Game Repair and Cache Update features.

As per current implementation, the notification only supports text-based content.

### **[New]** Rewritten Http/Downloader submodule, by @neon-nyan
As this brings many things, and pains (in terms of code time), we finally decided to rewrite our downloader submodule: [``Hi3Helper.Http``](https://github.com/CollapseLauncher/Hi3Helper.Http). The code has been running since the very beginning of this project was created and had been the most cluttered codebase that we have ever managed. Hundreds of bugs have been squashed from this submodule alone and it was very inefficient.

In this refactor, we managed to pulled out many features into this codebase, including one of the **MOST REQUESTED** feature in this project: **Bandwidth/Speed Limiter**.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/952cf15d-7d0d-4099-9669-a267349b0c8f

Thanks to this rewrite, the download now does not require the launcher to split the downloaded file into separated chunks and all the chunk data will be written and pre-allocated directly into a single file.

### **[Imp]** Update Playtime when Game has been opened before the Launcher, by @neon-nyan
Previously, the playtime will not get updated when the game was launched before you open Collapse. Thanks to this change, the launcher will now be able to resume and save the last playtime when the game was launched first before the launcher and it also affect the timestamp on Discord RPC to get resumed as well.

  - This has benefits if you're performing download multiple files within a single Downloader instance for other purposes. By using delegates, you can subscribe the download progress to a specific file you wanted to track.
- **[Imp]** Adding zero-bytes data redundancy check
  - This feature is being added to (hopefully) fix a common issue where some area in the data might get zero-ed out while a write routine is not completely flushed properly due to hot-disposal or cancellation trigger. This feature utilizes **AVX2** and/or **SSE2** (if available) to check a much bigger portion of data (for 256-bit and 128-bit chunk of data respectively).

- **[Fix]** More IOSharingViolation fixes for multithreaded ForeachAsync, by @bagusnl
- **[Fix]** AccessDenied error in GameBoost mechanism, by @bagusnl

- **[Fix]** Various weird errors that might be caused by Optimization preference, by @neon-nyan & @bagusnl
  - We are noticing quite odd behaviors with some functions, critically Sophon and Http downloader and also SevenZipExtractor modules
  - This error does not seem to be reproducible in Debug environment, but recent development by @neon-nyan found that setting the optimization profile to `Speed` may cause compiler over optimization in certain areas.
  - This fix set the project's compiler optimization to `Size` instead (which is the default .NET behaviour).
  - If this fixes those errors that were problematic then good, if not then we have to rethink about those problematic modules...
