# ATTENTION!
If you have previously installed **1.0.55.2** build and you're planning to update your Honkai Impact 3rd game using Delta-Patch feature, **PLEASE** update your launcher to this build first (**1.0.55.4**) since we have some bugs in previous build that may cause a failure while using Delta-Patch to update your Honkai Impact 3rd game.
