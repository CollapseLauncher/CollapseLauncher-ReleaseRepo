# What's New?
## New Feature: Game Settings for Honkai: Star Rail (PR: #129)
Now, you can adjust some game settings within Collapse, including Graphics Settings, Custom FPS (up to 120 FPS) and Audio Settings. Keep in mind that this feature is still experimental and it might break the Game Settings menu in-game.
